        I'm Elijah Irizarry, and this is a little about me. I live in a suburb
        close to O'Hare airport. It is called Park Ridge,and I have lived there
        for about 7 years. I have one sibling, a sister, named Brianna. (W.I.P)

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="aboutme">
        I'm a second year ITM student at the the
        Illinois Institute of Technology, IIT for short. (And no not ITT, they
        suck.) I'm studying Information technology and Management. So far I've
        really enjoyed the classes on writing code in multiple languages such
        as Java, C++, Python, and etc. I hope to one day participate in a coding
        bootcamp to refine my skills, gain more knowledge, and gain more
        experience. I also hope to become part of the leadership academy on IIT.
        They are a cool organization, plus they pay your tuition when your a
        part of thier organization. (W.I.P)
